Introduction
  The design and implementation of remote-controlled and autonomous robot cars: The system integrates multiple sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers to achieve two modes of operation:
     (1) Remote-Controlled Mode: Manual operation via a joystick interface connected to a transmitter Arduino
     (2) Autonomous Mode: Navigation with externally connected sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor
